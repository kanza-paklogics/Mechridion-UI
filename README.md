# Template

This project is built using Next.js 13, TypeScript, Material UI, Tailwind, ESLint, and Prettier.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

After running the above command, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result. You can edit the page by modifying the app/page.tsx file, and the page will auto-update as you make changes.

API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. The endpoint for this API route can be found in the pages/api/hello.ts file.

Any files in the pages/api directory are treated as API routes rather than React pages.
